GOAL #1

The code I submitted shows the entire process of retrieving a dataset, cleaning the dataset, and using the data to create a basic linear regression model to predict a pitcher's WAR using their ERA. 
The purpose of this goal was to expose myself to the basics of extremely important python libraries such as numpy and matplotlib, which are used in many different industry or research settings.
This submission meets the goal because I was able to create a prototype of a linear regression model that could potentially predict WAR based on a pitcher's ERA.
